# How to duplicate table structure and data

```sql
CREATE TABLE new LIKE old;
INSERT INTO new SELECT * FROM old;
```

- `CREATE TABLE new` - create new table named ```new``` 
- `LIKE old` - our ```new``` table will have the same structure as ```old``` (our current table)
- `INSERT INTO new SELECT * FROM old` - will copy all the data from ```old``` to ```new```
