# Atomic select and update (e.g. fetch unique rows on each request)

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT id FROM tbl WHERE processed = 0 LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE tbl SET processed = 1 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

- `START TRANSACTION` - starts transaction
- `tbl` - table to select rows from
- `processed = 0` - condition to select rows from table
- `LIMIT 1` - select only one row
- `FOR UPDATE` - lock selected rows till they are updated by us
- `SET processed = 1` - updated selected row (after possible processing)
- `id = 2` - condition to update selected row (use fetched ID of a row)
- `COMMIT` - finish transaction (lock will be released after that)
