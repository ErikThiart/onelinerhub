# Export table or query into CSV

```sql
SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/dump.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
FROM tablename WHERE id > 10;
```

- `'/tmp/dump.csv'` - path to the final file (directory should be writeable by mysql)
- `FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','` - use ```,``` as a column separator
- `ENCLOSED BY '"'` - wrap column values into doublequotes
- `LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'` - line break
- `tablename` - name of the table to select data from
- `WHERE id > 10` - example query condition, you can use any query here, including ```WHERE```, ```ORDER```, ```GROUP``` ...
