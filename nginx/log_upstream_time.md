# How to log time it took upstream to process request

```nginx
http {
  log_format timings '[$time_local] $remote_addr: "$request" $upstream_response_time s';
  # ...
  
  server {
    # ...
    access_log /var/log/nginx/api.log timings;
```

- `log_format timings` - define named log format
- `$time_local` - full date time of request
- `$remote_addr` - client IP address
- `$request` - full HTTP request string
- `$upstream_response_time` - time it took upstream to process request and return response (3 decimals)
- `access_log` - sets log file path and format (```timings``` in our case)
