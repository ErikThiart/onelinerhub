# Delete an element from array by value

```php
if (( $k = array_search($val, $arr)) !== false ) unset($arr[$k]);
```

- `array_search(` - will find key of an element with `$val` value
- `$k` - will have key of searched element (if any was found)
- `$val` - value to search in array
- `$arr` - array to search value in
- `unset($arr\[$k\])` - remove found element from array
