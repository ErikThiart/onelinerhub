# Append line to a file

```php
file_put_contents('file.txt', 'some line' . "\n", FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);
```

- `file_put_contents` - writes text to a file
- `file.txt` - file path to append line to
- `'some line'` - text line to append to a file
- `"\n"` - new line symbol, so our line ends with line break
- `FILE_APPEND` - flag that asks php to append content rather than overwrite
- `LOCK_EX` - this will prevent others from writing this file at the same time
